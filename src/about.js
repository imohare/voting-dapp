    about:
      "Ever wondered if you should buy DOGE? Dogecoin is possibly the most well-known and best shitcoin to buy right now. This cryptocurrency was forked from Litecoin in 2013 and went largely unnoticed for several years. Moreover, Dogecoin was trading at less than half a cent per token for a very long time. That is before the so-called ‘meme coin’ was catapulted into the spotlight following support from popular online discussion boards such as WallStreetBets on Reddit. Of course, there was also a series of endorsing tweets from the likes of Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and even Mark Cuban.",

    about:
      "Shiba Inu is another token on this list that was created as a light-hearted alternative to the current status quo. This shitcoin was launched in 2020 and labelled itself as the ‘Dogecoin killer’. The cryptocurrency has zero underlying use cases so is a perfect example of what makes it ones of the best shitcoins right now. Although the lines are blurred on what characteristics make a shitcoin, Shiba Inu is 100% a meme token. Sure, even the best shitcoins are risky, yet Shiba Inu’s popularity is hard to deny. The cryptocurrency’s creators are also working to offer token holders greater real-world utility, which might help it gain further popularity.",

      "Apecoin was launched in 2022 by the team behind Bored Ape Yacht Club. For those unaware, this is a platform that’s made up of 10,000 one-of-a-kind collectible Bored Ape non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This platform offers some of the best NFTs to buy, all of which are based on the Ethereum blockchain. ApeCoin is an ERC-20 cryptocurrency with governance and utility features.

Within two days, Apecoin was trading at $17.75. At the time of writing, the shitcoin’s price is around 60% below this figure.",
